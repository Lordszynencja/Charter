## Download & Install

Download the latest version of Charter from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lordszynencja/Charter/releases/latest).

### Windows

**Currently, the installer is recognized by some antivirus software as a trojan, Windows Defender sometimes says it's `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml`, as there is no way to fix it other than to pay M$ money.
You have to deal with it by ignoring the issue or turning check for that file off in the software, however most antivirus scanners say that the file is clean.**
