## TODO

NOTE: This list is subject to change.

<details>
  <summary>TODO</summary>
  
new features:
- add RW/play/stop/FF buttons on GUI
- straightening beats when anchor is removed
- option to disable warnings
- vocal notes creation/deletion revamp
- preview of beats' movements when dragging them
- ability to shift all further beats
- smarter slides and linked notes
- add autogenerated fhp after slide ends
- join linked notes with same flags
- change vibrato tail for linked notes
- modern theme tail types
- auto fhp creating moving top fret instead of bottom fret if new is above
- edit tab with chord templates
- slide shape options
- tab notation under edit area
- add tabs with arrangements
- add tab with warnings
- new select options:
> - select all after etc.
> - select by clicking note tail
> - select like
> - select by string with list of filters?
- handling strings beyond max?
- FHP creation switch stretch/make new/ask user?
- multiple tracks preview
- better slowdowns
- quick paste section/phrase tab

bugs:
- when adding silence/beats the notes aren't moved forward
- bend gp5 import positions
- midi bass
- check tempo moving notes
- After accidentally linking the previous note to a chord at the start of a handshape (which removed the chord) when I recreated it, the notes behaved like individual notes and not like a chord. No matter what I tried I could not get it to properly treat it like a chord again. This caused it to display odd in both the 3D preview and in Rocksmith after building the project.

formats to add:
- gp8
- LRC
- FLAC audio
- psarc
  
3D preview:
- COUNT makes fhp appear, and END makes the disappear
- exploding notes with shaky camera
- tremolo should vibrate more
- arpeggios colored note shadows
- editable camera settings
- camera more like in RS
- string vibrating when plucked
- change how chord boxes look
- full chord box if chord has at least 3 notes

Future things:
- Campaign/Guitarcade
- NAM support/integration (Neural Amp Module)
- Local/Online Multiplayer
